          <p>My abstractions began as a form of communication in my first year of high school. 
          I drew curves and dots to conceal words, then transferred them to black paper which I cut and glued onto a white background. 
          My teacher, at the time, compared this first work to folds in a tablecloth, explaining that a fictional character she read about saw sentences in creases. 
          Weeks later, I returned to the pattern, stripping it of hidden letters and unnecessary spirals—sketching it in my class notes. 
          It no longer functioned as speech.</p>

          <p>After several months, I began to experiment with shadows to conceal the queen of chess in a drawing for my grandfather. 
          The pattern then developed fixed contours that contained colors. Friends related this stage to stained glass windows. 
          Eventually, the design lost its outlines and returned to its shifts in shadows (done in various techniques, such as stippling and hatching). 
          Classmates and teachers said it looked like succulents, flowers, webbing, or a fortification spectrum—depending on the placement of the gradients. 
          They thought it was a form of meditation, but I came to believe it was an unconscious, psychological band aid I had developed over the years.</p>

          <p>Since then, the pattern has come back every year in different mediums—such as papercutting, drawing, painting, and clay.</p>
